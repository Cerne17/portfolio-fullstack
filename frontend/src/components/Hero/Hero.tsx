            I am a Brazilian Full-Stack Engineer and a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering undergraduate at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). 
            While my engineering studies provided a rigorous foundation, my journey into software was truly sparked by discovering Conway's Game of Life.
            The realization that I could build entire systems from the ground up, blending my lifelong love for math and logic with pure creativity, ignited a passion that drives me to this day.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            This passion has led me to explore and deliver projects across multiple domains, from Web Development to Data Science and Machine Learning.
            What I love most is the multi-disciplinarity of it allâ€”seeing how a few simple concepts can emerge and combine to build complex solutions that solve real problems for real people.
            Ultimately, that is my goal: to use technology to make a tangible, positive impact.
