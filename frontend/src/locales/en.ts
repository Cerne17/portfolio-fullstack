          'Developed during the "Imersão IA" (a collaboration between Alura and Google), this project solves a classic academic pain point: converting chaotic handwritten notes into structured study materials. Moving beyond traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR), ProjetoNotas leverages the multimodal capabilities of Google\'s Gemini API. The system doesn\'t just "read" text; it interprets the semantic structure of handwritten pages to synthesize a clean, logically formatted PDF. It represents a shift from analog chaos to digital order, demonstrating practical product sense and advanced prompt engineering.',
